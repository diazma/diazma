        <img src="support-dexter.jpg" alt="Dexter in a call" height="auto" width="650">
        <p>Dexter is a respected member of his team. He has contributed to Open Source projects and he is also the editor of Javascript for cats. His daily routine includes: taking naps, taking a bath to clean his fur, purr when he sleeps over the keyboard, give technical support to users and fix bugs in the system.</p>
        <h2>Nerf gun enthusiast</h2>
        <img src="nerf.jpg" alt="Dexter" height="auto" width="650">
        <p>Dexter is a talented software developer, but his coworkers agree that he also shines as a very competitive player in the inter-office nerf wars. He likes to shoot at unsuspecting co-workers although there was one time that he shoot and went after the dart; after all he is a cat and everything that moves is a target for him. Silly Dexter!</p>
        <h2>Tea time and popcorn</h2>
        <img src="popcorn-tea.jpg" alt="Dexter" height="auto" width="650">
        <p>Another hobby of Dexter at the office is to eat popcorn out of his tiny teacup, made for cats. Other coworkers made fun of the fact he got a tiny teacup, but he thinks this teacup adjust well to his white furry paws and that the teacup can hold his popcorn. Talking aout popcorn! Did you know he was named the unofficial popcorn specialist? You can see him during the morning making a fresh batch of popcorn at the office.</p>
        <h2>Working</h2>
        <p>This tech-savvy cat is a very productive member of his team. He is an example that cats can be excellent pets and employees. He knows the following programming languages:</p>
